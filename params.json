Richard Klein, the Chicago basketball club’s first owner, chose Bulls as the nickname for his team when it joined the NBA in 1966, becoming the league’s 10th franchise.\r\nWhy Bulls? The Chicago Bulls Encyclopedia has the explanation:\r\n\r\nThe name denoted strength and power, and it tied in to the city’s meatpacking tradition and the Chicago Amphitheater’s (first home court of the Bulls) proximity to the famed Chicago Stockyards. The one-syllable directness of the Bulls was also in line with Chicago’s other team nicknames—Bears, (White) Sox, Cubs, and (Black) Hawks.\r\n\r\n“We were the meat capital of the world,” said Klein at the time. “At first, I was thinking of names like Matadors (funny how that worked out given today’s Matadors) or Toreadors, but if you think about it, no team with as many as three syllables in its nickname has ever had much success except for the Canadians. I was sitting around the house, kicking these names around with my wife and three sons, when my little son Mark said, ‘Dad, that’s a bunch of bull!’ I said, ‘That’s it! We’ll call them the Bulls!’ And that’s how the team got its nickname.”\r\n[Click Here To See The Chicago Bulls](http://www.nba.com/bulls/)\r\n\r\n### Golden State Warriors\r\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CHrHngUUAAAozxH.jpg).\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the Golden State Warriors where the Philadelphia Warriors from 1946-1962. Then from 1962-1971 they became the San Fransisco Warriors, when Franklin Mieuli purchased the team. The Warriors are the only NBA team that does not include the name of their state or city on their name, even though \"Golden State\" is a well-known nickname for California.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Miami Heat\r\n![](http://downloadwallpaperhd.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Miami-Heat-Ultimate-Players-HD-Wallpaper.png)\r\nWhen Miami was awarded an NBA franchise to begin play in 1988, team officials wanted to have the fans in South Florida involved in the naming, so a contest was held.\r\nAmong more than 5,000 entries submitted were Sharks, Barracudas, Flamingos, Palm Trees, Beaches, Heat, Suntan, Shade, Tornadoes and Floridians.\r\n“The Heat was it,” said the team’s general partner, Zev Bufman. “When you think of Miami, that’s what you think of.” \r\n\r\n### Cleveland Cavaliers\r\n![](http://blogstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/SportsBlogcom/2027672/0863195001427756040_filepicker.jpg)\r\nIn 1970, Cleveland’s newspaper, The Plain Dealer, held a contest to name the city’s new basketball club.\r\nContest winner Jerry Tomko wrote that the Cavaliers “represent a group of daring, fearless men, whose life’s pact was never surrender, no matter what the odds.”\r\nThe nickname is frequently shortened to Cavs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Click Here To Return Back My Home Page!!!](http://gwc123.github.io/giggle-laugh/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
